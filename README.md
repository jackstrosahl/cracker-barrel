Generates all possible outcomes of the [peg game](https://www.crackerbarrel.com/shop/toys-games/games/travel-games/peg-game?sku=606154) recursively, with progress printed.  Writes the "wins" (outcomes with one peg left) to a file, and prints how many losses were found.  Wins are in form (y,x) -> (y,x), one per line.
